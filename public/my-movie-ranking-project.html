<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
  Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob drama,
  based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful
  Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).
</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
  Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as
  disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads
  anything but a restricted life.
</p>
<h3>The Godfather Part II</h3>
<p>
  The compelling sequel to "The Godfather," contrasting the life of Corleone
  father and son.
